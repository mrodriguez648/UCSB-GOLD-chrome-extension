SBHacks IV Project: Google Chrome extension designed to read schedule info from UCSB's GOLD system and search for the required textbooks for classes
## Functionality
The goal of this extension was to ease the process of looking for textbooks for UCSB courses. Once a person logs into their GOLD account, and reaches the schedule section, a button will be created on the webpage, and schedule info related to course number and department will be automatically extracted. Clicking on loads a new page (or tab depending upon user browser settings) for the official textbook website for UCSB. From there, another button is created that, when clicked on, will automatically look up the textbooks you need for your classes.
